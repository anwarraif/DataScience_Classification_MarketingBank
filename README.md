Conclusion :
1. SVM and logistic regression have the highest accuracy among all but AUC graph in SVM has highest value than all of models
2. For learning curve in Cross Validation Score, KNN has overfitting but another model are well fitting
3. From scalability of model, Naive Bayes has the fastest fit times but SVM has the slowest fit times
4. From the performance model graph, SVM has the constant performance score while the fit times increase
5. SVM can be used as the baseline model to predict deposits subscribed by telephonic marketing
6. SVM and KNN has the same importance features previous,marital,education and also for Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bayes has the same importance features (Age
and campaign)
